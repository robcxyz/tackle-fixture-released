# tackle-fixture-released

A fixture for testing tackle providers. **DO NOT USE**

This is to test tackle providers when they have been released on GH with a tag. 

**If adding to this fixture, be sure to not release with the `AddedLaterReleasedFixtureHook` hook which is being tested as not being available for released providers**
